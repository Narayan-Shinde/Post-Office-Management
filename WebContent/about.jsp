<p class="lead">The Post Office Management System project is a web-based application designed to assist post office management and customers with various transaction details. This system aims to reduce manual labor by automating many post office processes, including the handling of savings bank (SB), recurring deposit (RD), and fixed deposit (FD) accounts, electricity and telephone bill payments, money orders, and more. The system also includes a tracking tool to monitor the location of posted items. With this application, post office staff can perform their duties more efficiently, and customers can access transaction details without visiting the post office. The system is primarily intended for government post offices and can be customized to meet specific user requirements.
